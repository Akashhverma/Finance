# Financial News Sentiment Analysis using LSTM and GRU

This project implements a sentiment analysis system for financial news using deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The models classify the sentiment of news articles into three categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**. The goal of this project is to predict market trends based on financial news, which can help traders and investors make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies news headlines into Positive, Negative, and Neutral categories.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 76% accuracy in predicting sentiment using LSTM and GRU models.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Deployed the model on **localhost** using **Streamlit** for real-time predictions and interactive visualizations.
- **Work in Progress**: Currently working on deploying the app on **Streamlit Cloud** for public access.
